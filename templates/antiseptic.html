        <b>Antiseptics</b> are substances used to prevent the growth of microorganisms on living tissues, such as skin
        and mucous membranes. They play a crucial role in maintaining hygiene and preventing infections, especially in
        medical and surgical settings. Antiseptics are applied to the skin or mucous membranes to reduce the risk of
        infection by eliminating or inhibiting the growth of harmful microorganisms.<br><br>

        <b>History:</b> The concept of antisepsis dates back to the 19th century, with significant advancements made by
        pioneers like Joseph Lister. Lister introduced antiseptic techniques in surgery, using carbolic acid (phenol) to
        sterilize instruments and disinfect wounds. His methods greatly reduced the incidence of post-surgical
        infections and revolutionized surgical practices, leading to safer procedures and improved patient
        outcomes.<br><br>

        <b>How antiseptics work:</b> Antiseptics function by disrupting the cellular processes of microorganisms,
        leading to their death or inhibition. Different antiseptics work in various ways; for example, some may damage
        the microbial cell wall, while others interfere with cellular metabolism or protein synthesis. Common
        antiseptics include alcohols (like ethanol and isopropanol), iodine-based solutions (like povidone-iodine), and
        chlorhexidine. Each type has specific applications and effectiveness against various microorganisms.<br><br>

        <b>Types of antiseptics:</b> There are several types of antiseptics, each with distinct properties and uses:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alcohols:</b> Often used for hand sanitizers and skin disinfection, alcohols such as ethanol and
            isopropanol are effective against many bacteria and viruses.</li>
        <li><b>Iodine-based antiseptics:</b> Solutions like povidone-iodine are commonly used in wound care and surgical
            settings due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.</li>
        <li><b>Chlorhexidine:</b> Used in hand scrubs, mouthwashes, and preoperative skin disinfection, chlorhexidine is
            effective against a wide range of bacteria and some viruses.</li>
        <li><b>Hydrogen peroxide:</b> Known for its effervescence when applied to wounds, hydrogen peroxide helps to
            clean wounds and remove debris, though it can also damage healthy tissue.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <b>Applications:</b> Antiseptics are used in various settings, including healthcare, personal hygiene, and household
    cleaning. In healthcare, they are essential for preparing skin before injections or surgeries, treating wounds, and
    maintaining sterile environments. In personal hygiene, antiseptic products like hand sanitizers help prevent the
    spread of infections. In household settings, antiseptics are used for cleaning surfaces and reducing the risk of
    cross-contamination.<br><br>

    <b>Safety and considerations:</b> While antiseptics are effective in preventing infections, their use must be
    balanced with considerations for safety. Overuse or improper use of antiseptics can lead to skin irritation,
    allergic reactions, or the development of resistant microorganisms. It is important to follow guidelines for their
    use and to choose appropriate antiseptics based on the specific needs and contexts. Additionally, some antiseptics
    may not be suitable for certain populations or conditions, so professional advice should be sought when
    necessary.<br><br>

    <b>Future developments:</b> Research continues to explore new antiseptics and improve existing ones, with a focus on
    enhancing efficacy, reducing side effects, and addressing issues such as microbial resistance. Advances in
    antiseptic technology may lead to more effective solutions for infection prevention and better outcomes in medical,
    hygiene, and public health practices.
