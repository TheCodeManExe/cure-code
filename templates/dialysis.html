    <b>Dialysis</b> is a medical treatment that replicates the essential functions of the <b>kidneys</b> when they are
    no longer able to effectively filter waste products and excess fluids from the blood. This process is crucial for
    patients with <b>chronic kidney disease (CKD<a style="font-size: 2px;" href="/abcdef12345">.</a>)</b> or <b>acute kidney failure</b>, conditions in which the kidneys
    are significantly impaired.<br><br>

    There are two primary types of dialysis: <b>hemodialysis</b> and <b>peritoneal dialysis</b>. <b>Hemodialysis</b>
    involves diverting blood from the body into a dialysis machine where it is filtered through a special membrane,
    removing waste products and excess fluids. The cleaned blood is then returned to the body. This procedure is
    typically performed in a <b>dialysis center</b> three times a week, with each session lasting about four
    hours.<br><br>

    <b>Peritoneal dialysis</b>, on the other hand, uses the patientâ€™s own abdominal cavity as a filter. A special
    solution called <b>dialysate</b> is introduced into the abdominal cavity through a catheter. This solution absorbs
    waste products and excess fluids from the blood vessels in the abdominal lining. After a set period, the dialysate
    is drained from the abdomen and replaced with fresh solution. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed manually or with
    the help of a machine and is often done at home.<br><br>

    Both types of dialysis come with their own benefits and limitations. <b>Hemodialysis</b> is generally performed in a
    controlled clinical environment and can be more efficient in rapidly removing toxins. However, it requires frequent
    visits to the dialysis center and can be associated with complications such as low blood pressure and infections.
    <b>Peritoneal dialysis</b> offers greater flexibility and can be done at home, but it requires careful management to
    avoid infections like peritonitis and may not be suitable for all patients.<br><br>

    Dialysis is a life-saving treatment but is not a cure for kidney disease. It aims to manage symptoms and improve
    quality of life. For many patients, <b>kidney transplantation</b> is the preferred long-term solution, though it is
    not always an option due to donor availability or medical conditions.<br><br>

    Overall, dialysis plays a crucial role in managing kidney failure and requires ongoing care and monitoring to ensure
    effectiveness and address any potential complications. It allows patients to maintain their daily lives and health
    while managing the limitations imposed by their kidney condition.<br>
