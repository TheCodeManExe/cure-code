        Interviewer: Sarah, thank you for being here. How is AI changing the patient experience in healthcare?<br><br>

        Sarah Johnson: Thank you for having me. AI is enhancing the patient experience in several ways. AI-powered
        chatbots and virtual assistants, for example, provide patients with information about their conditions, answer
        common questions, and assist with appointment scheduling. This accessibility helps patients manage their
        healthcare more efficiently and conveniently, reducing the need for in-person interactions for every
        query.
        <br><br>
        Interviewer: What are some potential drawbacks or concerns related to AI in patient care?
        <br><br>
        Sarah Johnson: While AI brings many benefits, there are concerns to address. One issue is the potential for
        depersonalization, where interactions might feel too robotic or impersonal. There is also a risk of
        over-reliance on AI tools, which might diminish human oversight. Data privacy and security are critical concerns
        as AI systems handle large amounts of personal health data. Ensuring robust safeguards and maintaining a balance
        between technology and human interaction is essential.
        <br><br>
        Interviewer: What steps can be taken to address these concerns?
        <br><br>
        Sarah Johnson: To address these concerns, transparency and patient education are key. Patients should understand
        how AI is used in their care and have the choice to opt-out if desired. Robust data security measures and
        compliance with privacy regulations are crucial. Additionally, AI should complement rather than replace human
        care, maintaining a personal touch in patient interactions while leveraging technology to enhance care
        quality.
