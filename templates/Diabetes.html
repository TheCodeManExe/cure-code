    <b>Diabetes</b> is a chronic medical condition characterized by high levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. It
    occurs when the body is either unable to produce sufficient insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar, or cannot
    effectively use the insulin it produces. This leads to an accumulation of glucose in the blood, which can cause a
    variety of health complications if left untreated.<br><br>

    <b>Types of diabetes:</b> There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1, Type 2, and gestational diabetes. <b>Type
      1 diabetes</b>, also known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks
    and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This type usually develops in childhood or adolescence and
    requires lifelong insulin therapy. <b>Type 2 diabetes</b> is the most common form and typically develops in adults,
    though it is increasingly seen in younger people. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the
    pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs. <b>Gestational diabetes</b> occurs during pregnancy
    and usually resolves after childbirth, but it increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in
    life.<br><br>

    <b>Causes and risk factors:</b> The exact cause of diabetes varies depending on the type. Type 1 diabetes is
    believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as viral infections, that trigger
    the immune system to attack the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is primarily linked to lifestyle factors, including poor
    diet, physical inactivity, obesity, and genetics. Family history, age, and ethnicity also play significant roles in
    the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is associated with hormonal changes during pregnancy
    that affect insulin sensitivity.<br><br>

    <b>Symptoms:</b> Common symptoms of diabetes include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger,
    unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores. In Type 1 diabetes, these symptoms can
    develop rapidly over a few weeks, while in Type 2 diabetes, they often develop more gradually and may be less
    noticeable. If left untreated, high blood sugar levels can lead to serious complications, including cardiovascular
    disease, nerve damage (neuropathy), kidney disease (nephropathy), eye problems (retinopathy), and an increased risk
    of infections.<br><br>

    <b>Management and treatment:</b> Managing diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and
    regular monitoring of blood sugar levels. For Type 1 diabetes, insulin therapy is essential, and it may be delivered
    through injections or an insulin pump. Type 2 diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle modifications such as a
    healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and oral medications or insulin if necessary. Monitoring blood glucose
    levels is critical for both types, as it helps in adjusting treatment plans and preventing complications.
    Additionally, individuals with diabetes are encouraged to undergo regular medical check-ups to monitor for potential
    complications and manage any arising issues.<br><br>

    <b>Prevention and awareness:</b> While Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, Type 2 diabetes can often be delayed or
    prevented through lifestyle changes. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in whole grains,
    fruits, and vegetables, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding excessive sugar intake are all effective
    strategies for reducing the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Public awareness and education about the risks and
    management of diabetes are crucial in helping individuals make informed choices and take proactive steps toward
    their health.<br><br>

    <b>Importance of early detection:</b> Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes are essential to prevent the onset
    of complications. Regular screening, especially for individuals at high risk, can lead to timely interventions that
    improve quality of life and reduce the burden of the disease. As research continues, advancements in treatment
    options and technology, such as continuous glucose monitors and artificial pancreas systems, are making diabetes
    management more effective and less intrusive, offering hope for better outcomes for those living with the condition.
